  m_Text: "The pain returned to Ooga's head, but this time his fears were confirmed.\r
    The scene displayed before him was not one of peace and tranquility as they had
    been before.\r\nIt was one of death.\r\nA thick fog had rolled over the entire
    clearing.\r Bodies of those he once knew were strewn across the jungle floor.\r
    Small, grotesque beasts were dashing back and forth, sinking their teeth into
    anything that tried to run.\r They reminded him of rabbits, only these creatures
    definitely were not of the living.\r It was a chaotic sight that made Ooga shudder.\r
    His family cowered in their hut, hoping the creatures would leave them unnoticed.\r
    Ooga was about to call to them, to tell them to flee, but a tree came crashing
    down on him, sending him to the ground in a daze.\r As his consciousness faded,
    he could only remember one distinct memory.\r\nA large, booming sound echoed throughout
    the clearing, as if the entire scene was being torn apart.\r Before losing conscienceness
    entirely, Ooga looked back towards his hut, desperately hoping his family had
    escaped.\r A large shape approached his hut and reared upwards, letting loose
    a bloodcurdling scream.\r All of the small creatures fled the scene in a panic,
    leaving only Ooga to watch as the shape came crashing down on his hut, leaving
    nothing remaining.....\r\n\nOoga awakened from his trance, his worries now replaced
    with rage.\r All the peace that was disrupted, all the life that was lost by the
    hand of this scourge.\r Ooga would find the perpetrator, and make sure their life
    was silenced."
