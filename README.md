# AscensionGame
Initial README for project

The game is begun from the starting screen by left-clicking basically anywhere on the starting screen.

Controls are WASD for moving (or arrow keys if left-handed). Left click swings weapon or fires arrow. 1NUM uses fire attack.

Objective (to put it simply) is to gather memories located in chests in levels. Chests can only be accessed by clearing all
enemies on the level. The final level can only be accessed by reaching all of the chests.

Game over or victory will result in screen alerting you of so, and allowing you to exit program.

Play it with sound! The music is great!
